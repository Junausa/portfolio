## About me

Producing your winning moments since 2016. Building live events of all sizes–from invitational competitions with high-profile talent, to the largest open-bracket esports tournaments to exist. Roots in Midwest America and broadcasting platform fighting games, now I prefer to produce events and manage broadcast crews. Recently moved to Southern California. I started by creating a Smash Bros. club at my college and hosting events there. Eventually organized regionals in Chicago before moving up to majors at an international scale.

Creating live shows in the gaming and esports space with [Maelstrom Entertainment](https://mse.gg/).
