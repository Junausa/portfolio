I’m a live event producer and broadcast director with nearly a decade of experience creating standout moments in esports. I build shows that feel as good as they run—balancing structure and adaptability to serve players, fans, and everyone behind the scenes.</p><p>I started by founding a Super Smash Bros. club in college and hosting local events on campus. That grew into organizing regional tournaments in Chicago, and eventually, producing majors at an international scale. Since then, I’ve worked across the full event lifecycle—from acquiring contracts and managing six-figure budgets to running show flow and coordinating on-air talent.</p><p>My credits include Genesis, Battle of BC, LACS Rivals, Red Bull Kumite, Scuffed World Tour, Evo, Combo Breaker, and Team Liquid’s Race to World First, where I contributed as both an audio engineer and associate producer. I currently work as an Account Manager and Producer at <a href="https://mse.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Maelstrom Entertainment</a>, and have previously led projects with Waveform, <a href="https://level1.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Level1 TV</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/meleeeveryday" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Melee Everyday</a>.</p><p>Above all, I care about building events that are intentional, collaborative, and built to deliver under pressure.</p><p style="text-align:center;font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em;">❖ CONTACT: <a href="mailto:juna@mse.gg">juna@mse.gg</a></p>',7))]))}});export{j as __pageData,q as default};
