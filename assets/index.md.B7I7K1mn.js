Building live events of all sizes–from invitational competitions with high-profile talent, to the largest open-bracket esports tournaments to exist. Roots in Midwest America and broadcasting platform fighting games, now I prefer to produce events and manage broadcast crews. Recently moved to Southern California. I started by creating a Smash Bros. club at my college and hosting events there.
